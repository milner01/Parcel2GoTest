-- Parcel2GoTest --

There are 2 projects within the solution. A class library named "Parcel2GoTest" and an MS Test project named "Parcel2GoTestTests"

The 3 Acceptance criteria for the test (defined in Example 1, 2, 3) are within the unit test project. As well as two additional tests. 

The implementation is defined within the ICheckout interface and Checkout class. 

Thank you,
CM
